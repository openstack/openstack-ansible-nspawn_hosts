# === systemd-nspawn defaults ==================================================
# Default networks that will be applied ONLY to nspwan deployments.
nspawn_networks:
  nspawn_address:
    # The name of the interface, by default this is a dummy device on a private
    # network however it could be a bridge or any other interface.
    bridge: "nspawn0"
    # Optional | Set bool to enable a private device. This will create a bridge
    #            not connecting to the underlying L2.
    private_device: true
    # Optional | Enable or disable dhcp on this network
    enable_dhcp: true
    # Optional | When dhcp is enabled set the IP address range
    dhcp_range: 10.0.4.2,10.0.4.129
    # Optional | Set the address for the macvlan network
    address: 10.0.4.1
    # Optional | Set the netmask for the macvlan network
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
    # Optional | Set the macvlan mode
    macvlan_mode: bridge

# Primary interface used for host to container communications. In the event that
# the underlying system is running a condensed network stack a route will be
# created for all networks that have a defined `cidr` using the primary
# interface. In the event that an address is defined for a given network Ansible
# facts will be used to determine if an address needs to be assigned to the
# macvlan interface.
#
# + simple example:
#   management_cidr: "172.29.236.0/24"
#   container_networks:
#     management_address:
#       bridge: eth0
#
# In this example the `managemen_cidr` corresponds to the `management_address`
# network and because there's no IP address within the address block a route is
# used allowing the host to communicate with the containers. For the route to be
# added using any network, the network must have a corresponding CIDR with no
# defined address.
#
# Multiple macvlans can be spawned from a single host interface.
# + simple example:
#   management_cidr: "172.29.236.0/24"
#   storage_cidr: "10.0.0.0/24"
#   container_networks:
#     management_address:
#       bridge: eth0
#     storage_address:
#       bridge: eth0
#       address: 10.0.0.100
#       netmask: 255.255.255.0
#     tunnel_address:
#       bridge: eth0.10
#
# In this example management storage and tunnel networks will be created and
# attached to the containers.
#  + The management network will have a route created for its corresponding CIDR
#  + The storage network will have the defined address added to the macvlan
#    interface with `scope` set to `host`, assuming the address is not already
#    assigned to the underlying interface, "eth0".
#  + The tunnel network will be attached to the container and isolated from the
#    host with no access to without first attaching to the container.
